# Redstone

Self-hosted CLI backup tool, made for personal files.

Redstone is an incremental backup application, no need to reupload unchanged files.


This is the client repository. If youâ€™re looking for the server [click here](https://github.com/hammsvietro/redstone_server).

# Installation

As of now, the instalation script is only available on linux using systemD,
but the code is written to work with all major operating systems.


```bash
git clone https://github.com/hammsvietro/redstone.git
./install-linux.sh
systemctl enable redstone.service --user --now
```

#### Requirements
* Rust
* Cargo

# Usage

All the available commands can be viewed with:
```bash
redstone --help
```

After installing the client, you should connect to the [redstone server](https://github.com/hammsvietro/redstone_server) and login.
The commands for those actions are listed below.

## Commands

### Server config
Configure which server the client points to.
```bash
# redstone server-config <ADDRESS> [--port 80 --use-https]
$ redstone server-config 192.168.0.67 --port 4000

```
The address should contain only the hostname (do not specify protocols nor ports)

### Login

```bash
$ redstone auth
```

Accounts cannot be created via CLI, only in the web page.

### Track
Create a new backup and store the data in the server.
```bash
# redstone track <backup-name> [path]
$ redstone track my_first_backup .
```

The specified directory (current by default)  will be scanned recursively and all files will be sent to the server

A `.rsignore` file can be used to ignore folder and files, similar to `.gitignore`

### Clone
Create a copy of a existing backup in the current directory.
```bash
# redstone clone <backup-name>
$ redstone clone my_first_backup
```

All the data stored in the server will be pulled, similar to `git clone` 

### Status
Display all new, changed and deleted files.
```bash
$ redstone status
```

Similar to `git status`

### Pull
Pull latest changes from the server.
```bash
$ redstone pull
```

### Push
Push changes to the server.
```bash
$ redstone push
```

Pushing data is only allowed when the local files are up to date with the server.
